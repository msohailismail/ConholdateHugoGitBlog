So in order to control the embedding of fonts in the resultant document, we need to use IsEmbedFonts property.\nThe unit of measurement in Aspose.PDF is Points. And, we know that A3 measures 297 × 420 millimeters or 11.69 × 16.54 inches. So, the dimensions are rounded off to 842 × 1190 points. In the following code snippet, we are adjusting the page size of the resultant document as A3 and page orientation as Landscape.\nConvert Web page to PDF Other than the conversion of HTML files, we may also have a requirement to directly convert a web page to PDF format. So in order to accomplish this requirement, first we will fetch the remote Web page contents using the HttpClient instance, create a Stream object and then pass the Stream instance to the Document object. The reason we need the content in Stream is that the Document instance only accepts files or steam objects.\nThe following section explains the steps on how to convert a Web page to PDF using C#\n Read the contents of the page using an HttpClient object Instantiate the HtmlLoadOptions object and set the base URL Initialize a Document object and pass the stream object and HtmlLoadOptions instance as arguments Call the Save(String) method from the Document class to generate the output  Render complete HTML on a single page During the HTML to PDF conversion, the length of the resultant file is according to the content length of an input HTML document. Therefore, if the input HTML is comprised of multiple pages, then the resultant file will also span over multiple pages. However, we may confine the output to a single PDF page. In order to accomplish this requirement, the IsRenderToSinglePage property of HtmlLoadOptions class can be used.\nGiven below is the code snippet for rendering the complete HTML content on a single PDF page using C#.\nGet a Free License You may request a free temporary licenseto try the API without any evaluation limitations.\nConclusion In this article, we have learned about the approach of converting HTML files to PDF format using .NET API.

TotalColumns Gets or sets total columns’ count to export from a data source. -1 means all columns of the given data source. TotalRows Gets or sets total rows’ count to export from the data source. -1 means all rows of the given data source.  In the following example, we are exporting data from a collection of objects to a worksheet containing merged cells. We are setting the value of ImportTableOptions.CheckMergedCells property to true as the Excel document contains merged cells.\nExport Data to an Excel Document Containing Merged CellsCopies Rows and Columns from one Excel file to Another in C# We can programmatically copy rows and columns from one Excel document to another. When a row (or column) is copied, the data contained in it, including formulas – with updated references – and values, comments, formatting, hidden cells, images, and other drawing objects are also copied. We can also copy rows and columns within the same worksheet or across different worksheets in an Excel document. Aspose.Cells provides the following methods to copy rows and columns.\n CopyRow(Cells sourceCells, int sourceRowIndex, int destinationRowIndex) Copies data of a single row. CopyRows(Cells sourceCells, int sourceRowIndex, int destinationRowIndex, int rowNumber) Copies data of multiple rows. CopyColumn(Cells sourceCells, int sourceColumnIndex, int destinationColumnIndex) Copies data of a single column. CopyColumns(Cells sourceCells, int sourceColumnIndex, int destinationColumnIndex, int columnNumber) Copies data of multiple columns.  The following example code shows how to copy rows from one Excel document to another in C#.\nThe following example code shows how to copy specific rows of one Excel document to another.\nWe can similarly copy columns’ data from one Microsoft Excel document to another using CopyColumn or CopyColumns method.\nExport DataTable to Excel in C# Data from ADO.NET objects such as DataTable, DataColumn, and DataView can be exported to Excel worksheets. To export data from a DataTable, we call the ImportData method of Cells collection. There are many overloaded versions of the ImportData method but we use the following:\nThe description of the parameters is given below:\n table The DataTableobject to be exported. firstRow The row number of the first cell to export to. firstColumn The column number of the first cell to export to. optionsType ImportTableOptions object.  In the following code sample, we are creating a DataTable object that has three columns and two rows. And exporting it to an Excel worksheet.\nExport DataTable to ExcelExport Data of Selective DataColumns to Excel in C# We can export selective DataColumns of a DataTable or DataView to an Excel document. As discussed earlier, the ImportData method accepts an argument of type ImportTableOptions. The ImportTableOptions class has a ColumnIndexes property that accepts an array of columns indexes (zero-based) that we want to export. In the following code sample, we are exporting only two DataColumns of a DataTable to an Excel Worksheet.\nThe output of DataColumns to ExcelExport Data from DataView to Excel in C# A DataView is a view on a DataTable that can be customized to present a subset of data from the DataTable. We use the following overloaded version of the ImportData method to export data from DataView to an Excel document.\nWe know there are two ways to create a DataView. We can use the DataView constructor, or we can create a reference to the DefaultView property of the DataTable. In the following code sample, we are using the later way to create a DataView.\nExport Data from DataGrid and GridView to Excel in C# Aspose.Cells library allows us to export data from Microsoft Grid controls such as DataGrid and GridView to an Excel worksheet. It provides ImportDataGrid method, to export data from a DataGrid and ImportGridView method to export data from a GridView.\nThere are many overloaded versions of the ImportDataGrid method but a typical overload takes the following parameters:\n dataGrid, the DataGrid object that we’re exporting content from. firstRow, the row number of the first cell that the data will be exported to. firstColumn, the column number of the first cell that the data will be exported to. insertRows, a Boolean property that indicates whether extra rows should be added to the worksheet to fit data. importStyle, a Boolean property that indicates whether cell style should be exported.  The following code example shows how to export data from DataGrid to an Excel file in C#.\nExport HTML formatted Data to Excel in C# Aspose.Cells lets you export HTML formatted data to an Excel worksheet. The API parses HTML formatted text while exporting data and convert the HTML into formatted cell values. In the following sample code, DataTable contains HTML formatted text and we are exporting it to an Excel Document using ImportData method.\nThe output of HTML Exported Data to an Excel DocumentExport HTML File to Excel in C# Aspose.Cells allows us to export an HTML file to Excel. The HTML file should be Microsoft Excel oriented, i.e., MS-Excel should be able to open it.\nExport JSON Data to Excel in C# Sometimes we have a need to export JSON Data to an Excel document. With Aspose.Cells we can easily do this with a few lines of code. Aspose.Cells provides a JsonUtility class that has an ImportData method for exporting JSON data to an Excel document. The ImportData method accepts JsonLayoutOptions object as a parameter. The JsonLayoutOptions class represents the options of JSON layout and has the following properties.\n ArrayAsTable: Indicates whether the array should be processed as a table. ConvertNumericOrDate: Gets or sets a value that indicates whether the string in JSON is to be converted to numeric or date. DateFormat: Gets and sets the format of the date value. IgnoreArrayTitle: Indicates whether to ignore the title if the property of the object is an array. IgnoreNull: Indicates whether the null value should be ignored. IgnoreObjectTitle: Indicates whether to ignore the title if the property of the object is an object. NumberFormat: Gets and sets the format of the numeric value. TitleStyle: Gets and sets the style of the title.  In the following example code, we are exporting JSON data to an Excel file in C#.\nExport JSON Data to ExcelExport CSV Data to Excel in C# A comma-separated values (CSV) file is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values. A CSV file typically stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text, in which case each line will have the same number of fields.\nThe following code sample shows how we can open a CSV file and save it as an Excel file using Aspose.Cells library.\nCSV to an Excel DocumentConclusion In this post, you have seen how easily you can export data to Excel in C# from Array, DataTable, DataView, DataGrid and GridView. You have also seen how to export HTML, JSON, CSV Data to an Excel worksheet. Please check the documentation to learn more about these and several other features that Aspose.Cells API offers.

Real-time collaborative editing of the same document. Multiple users can access the document at the same time and modify it. Upload content of an existing Word Document into an editor.  In this blog post, we will extend our web-application to include the following features:\n Download content of the editor as MS Word, PDF, TXT or HTML document. Share the URL with friends so that they can edit the document at the same time.  The final product will look as follows: Download Content of the Editor As  Microsoft Word Document PDF Document Plain Text Document   Share URL of an Editor with friends  Download Content of the Editor as Microsoft Word Document First, we add an  element of type submit to our form to show the “Download Document” button on the front-end. We use asp-page-handler attribute to specify the handler of the button. Our form element now looks as follows:\nYou may have noticed that we have added another  element of type hidden. This element is bound to DocumentContent property in Index.cshtml.cs. We will use this property to store the content of the editor as an HTML string.\nFirepad provides another event synced for listening. It is fired when our local client edits the document and when those edits have been successfully written to Firebase. We attach a callback to this event type in order to set the value of DocumentContent property to firepad.getHtml(). Please add the following code in the init() function in Index.cshtml.\nNow we implement the functionality of OnPostDownloadDocument() handler. We use GroupDocs.Editor library to save contents of the editor as Microsoft Word document, which are stored in DocumentContent property. The handler returns the Word document as a response to the user.\nUploadedDocumentPath variable is defined as a volatile string to keep the value of the uploaded document path between sessions.\nPlease check Save Document and Create EditableDocument from file or markup articles to learn more about GroupDocs.Editor classes.\nRun the project and test the following use case:\n Upload content of an existing Word document into an editor by clicking on the Upload Document button. Make desired changes in the content. Click on the Download Document button to download the updated content as a Word Document.  Download Content of the Editor as PDF Document We need to make a few modifications in OnPostDownloadDocument() handler to return PDF document as a response. We use PdfSaveOptions instead of WordProcessingSaveOptions and use application/pdf as a MIME type.\nDownload Content of the Editor as Plain Text Document In order to return a plain text document (.txt) as a response, we use TextSaveOptions class and use text/plain as a MIME type.\nShare URL of an Editor with friends We should provide users with a convenient way to copy the URL of an editor and share it with friends. To do this, add an  element of type text in Index.cshtml.\nAdd the above  element before  tag. We set value of this text input field to URL of an editor by using the following line of code. Add this code in init() function in Index.cshtml.\nWe will make minor changes to our CSS to ensure that the text input field is shown properly. Set top position of firepad and userlist to 100px, and add a left margin to the text input field.\nRun the project, you should see a text field that lets you copy the URL of the editor. Share it with your friends and edit the document simultaneously with them.\nComplete source code of the project is available on GitHub.\nSee Also  https://blog.conholdate.com/2020/06/22/build-your-own-google-docs-like-app/  ","permalink":"/2020/06/29/build-your-own-google-docs-like-app-part-two/","summary":"In the first blog post, we created a Google Docs like web app that has the following features:\n Rich Text Editing (change text font, size, colour, style (boldface, italic), alignment etc.).

Google Docs is a word processor that allows users to create and edit files online while collaborating with other users in real-time.\nThis blog post explains how easy it is to create a lite version of Google Docs that has the following features:\n Rich Text Editing (change text font, size, colour, style (boldface, italic), alignment etc.). Real-time collaborative editing of the same document. Multiple users can access the document at the same time and modify it. Upload content of an existing Word Document into an editor. Save text in the editor as MS Word, PDF, TXT or HTML document.  Our end product will look as follows: Tools and Technologies Integrate Firepad Upload Content of an Existing Word Document into an Editor Integrate GroupDocs.Editor Form Data Handling  Tools and Technologies – Create Google Docs like App We will develop the Google Docs like web app in ASP.NET Core and use the following two libraries:\n Firepad is an open-source, collaborative text editor. It uses the Firebase Realtime Database as a backend so it requires no server-side code and can be added to any web app simply by including the JavaScript files. GroupDocs.Editor for .NET gives us an ability to edit most popular document formats using any WYSIWYG editor without any additional applications. We will load document via GroupDocs.Editor into Firepad, edit document in a way we want and save it back to original document format.  I have used Visual Studio for Mac as an IDE. However, you can download the free community edition of Visual Studio, depending upon your platform, from here. Let’s start.\nCreate a new ASP.NET Core Web Application project and name the project “GoogleDocsLite”.\nRun the application to ensure everything is set up properly.\nIntegrate Firepad We can add Firepad to our web app by including the following JavaScript files in the  section of _Layout.cshtml.\nTo create a Firepad, we will initialize Firebase, CodeMirror and then Firepad. Add the following script and HTML code in Index.cshtml.\nPlease replace the contents of config with your own Firebase project’s config.\nWe want the above script to execute once a web page has completely loaded all content (script files, CSS files etc.). So, call init() function from the onLoad event attribute of  element in _Layout.cshtml.\nYour element should look as follows. If it contains unnecessary tags like , , please remove them.\nIf you run the project, you will notice that firepad and userlist are not aligned properly. Please use the following CSS code to adjust the size/position of the firepad and userlist. You may add the following code within  element of _Layout.cshtml.\nFirepad has been successfully set up.\nUpload Content of an Existing Word Document into an Editor Now we want to give our users a way to upload content of an exiting Word Document in the text editor. On the frontend, we add an  element of type file that lets a user select a Word Document from their local machine. On the backend, we use GroupDocs.Editor library to retrieve the content of a Word Document as HTML string. Finally, we use Firepad’s setHtml() method to show content in the text editor.\nAdd the following  element in Index.cshtml file before  tag.\nIn Index.cshtml.cs file, define a corresponding property.\nRun the project and click on the Choose file button. Select a Word Document that you want to upload and click on the Upload Document button. Nothing will happen because we have not yet defined the handler in Index.cshtml.cs. Before we do this, let’s first add GroupDocs.Editor library in our project.\nIntegrate GroupDocs.Editor GroupDocs.Editor is available as a NuGet package so we can easily add it to our project. Right-click on the project and select Manage NuGet Packages option. The Manage NuGet Packages window will open, select the Browse tab, and enter GroupDocs.Editor in the search field. GroupDocs.Editor should appear as a first result, select it and then click on Add Package button.When the package is successfully added, it will appear under NuGet subfolder in the Dependencies folder.\nForm Data Handling Now we write a handler (OnPostUploadDocument() method) that will be called when a user clicks on Upload Document button. UploadedDocument object (of type IFormFile) contains content of the uploaded document. First, we save the document on the server then use GroupDocs.Editor library to get its content as HTML string. Please add the following code in Index.cshtml.cs file.\nFirepad provides two events for listening. One of them is ‘ready‘ which fires once Firepad has retrieved the initial editor contents. We attach a callback to this event type and in the callback, we pass DocumentContent string as an argument to setHtml() method of firepad object. Please add the following code in the init() function in Index.cshtml.\nYou may have noticed that we passed the documentContent string first to htmlDecode() method before passing to setHtml() method. It is to replace character entities such as \u0026amp;lt, \u0026amp;gt with signs (\u0026lt; and \u0026gt;). The htmlDecode() method looks as follows.\nRun the project, now you should be able to upload the content of a Word Document into an editor.\nIn part II of this post, I have explained how we can extend our application to include the following features:\n Download content of the editor as MS Word, PDF, TXT or HTML document. Share the URL with friends so that they can edit the document at the same time.  Please check it out.\nComplete source code of the project is available on GitHub.\nSee Also  https://blog.conholdate.com/2020/06/29/build-your-own-google-docs-like-app-part-two/  ","permalink":"/2020/06/22/build-your-own-google-docs-like-app/","summary":"Several customers have approached us and asked how they can create a Google Docs like web app using our APIs.
